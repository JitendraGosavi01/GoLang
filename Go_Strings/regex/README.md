Go Regex package is used for searching string. To search a string, we need to provide a pattern of the string.

We need to compile the pattern into the regex object so that we can invoke methods through it.

The regex object can be retrieved by using compile() and mustcompile() functions. Now we can use functions to find strings such as FindString(), FindStringSubmatch(), FindStringIndex() etc.
