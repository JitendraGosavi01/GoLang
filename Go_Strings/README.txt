The Go string is a sequence of variable-width characters.

Go strings and text files occupy less memory or disk space. Since, UTF-8 is the standard, Go doesn't need to encode and decode strings.

Go Strings are value types and immutable. It means if you create a string, you cannot modify the contents of the string. The initial value of a string is empty "" by default.
